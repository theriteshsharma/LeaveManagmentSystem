Online Leave Management System is an application that is of utmost importance for an organization or college. The leave management application will allow the users to apply for the leaves through the online mode by specifying a valid reason for the leave. This can also be implemented at the school and the college levels where the students can apply for the leave. The user interface must by simple and easy to understand. The leave application and the approvals are done manually. This work can be automated through the use of this application. This application can also allow the users to check the pending leaves that they have.

Existing System:
*	Requesting leave from upper management through written application.
*	Authority checks leave history then grants leave.

Drawbacks:
*	Availability of authority required.
*	Lots of paperwork and time of both the parties is consumed in the process.

Proposed System:
*	Registration for company.
*	Supervisors – Representative of their company on the portal, handler of all the data to the portal.
*	Saving history digitally, requesting leaves from anywhere and easy process than usual.
